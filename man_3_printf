NAME:
        _printf.

SYNOPSIS:

        #nclude "main.h"

        int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION:

        The functions in the _printf() family produce output according to
        a format as described below.

        This function write a string how first argument into "" and after
        call a variadic functions of get for print with the caracter type
        for print correctly the info in the variable how an output.

    Flag characters:
        The character % is followed by zero or more of the following
        flags:

                None added now, soon its actived flags.

    Conversion specifiers:
         A character that specifies the type of conversion to be appiled.
         The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

        d, i    The int are a argument in decimal notation. This return the
                decimal number, calculed the length of the digit and after
                print digit for digit and return the complex num, and writing this
                in the console.

        c       The char character, its print when in the variable get alone a
                character, this character are print in console in the assigment
                position.

        s       The char string, get the string and print all characters into,
                Characters from the array are written up to (but not including)
                a terminating null byte ('\0').

        %       A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete
                conversion specification is '%%'.

RETURN VALUE:

        Upon successful return, these functions return the number of
        characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to
        strings).

        If you put the % and after of this the program see a space of a null
        byte ('\0'), the program return (-1).

EXAMPLES:

        To print a character:

           #include "main.h"

           _printf("%c",
                   'S');

        To print a string:

           #include "main.h"

           char string[] = "Hello World!;

           _printf("%s",
                   string);

        To print a integrer or double:

           #include "main.h"

           int day = 24, moth = 3, year = 2022;

           _printf("The date is %i/%d/%i",
                                day, moth, year);
